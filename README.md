# kudocs_test2
Test assignment for Kudocs. Now with using rails!

## Description:

```
The test should take you around 2 ~ 4 hours to complete.
The main purpose of the test is to see how you code and problem solve.

Some things we will be looking out for include:

* Readability - How easy is it to understand
 the code?

* Functionality - Is everything working
 as expected? We will run the tests and script to see.

* Efficiency - How clean and simple is
 the code?

* Testing - Your approach to tests and
 coverage.

* Code design & patterns - Your ability
 to use Object Oriented Programming and common patterns.

The test is to write
 a script that receives a log file as an argument (the example log file has been provided) and returns:

* A list of web pages with the most page
 views (ordered from most at the top to least at the bottom), and;

* A list of unique page views - where
 uniqueness can be determined from the visitorâ€™s IP address
 (also ordered from most at the top to least at the bottom).
```

## Solution:

* Ruby
